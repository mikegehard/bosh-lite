Running bosh-lite and cloudfoundry using a custom dns and offline
=================================================================

by Vinicius Carvalho

## Emulating Offline usage of BOSH

Run `bin/disable_container_internet` to disable Internet on containers except for DNS.

To re-enable Internet, run `bin/enable_container_internet`.

## Using custom DNS

### Install dnsmasq

A simple dns proxy for mac, its really easy to install if you have homebrew on your system

`brew install dnsmasq`

Follow the instructions at the end of the homebrew install to configure and start dnsmasq, which should look something like this: 

```
To configure dnsmasq, copy the example configuration to /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf
and edit to taste.

  cp /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.conf.example /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf

To have launchd start dnsmasq at startup:
    sudo cp -fv /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/*.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
Then to load dnsmasq now:
    sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
```

Modify the dnsmasq configuration file to add an entry for your custom DNS, for example:

`address=/.vincloud.com/10.244.0.34`

Will add a wildcard domain pointing to my HA-PROXY machine in cloudfoundry.

Go to your network preferences and add `127.0.0.1` as your first DNS server.

### Modify cf-release

Next step, edit `cf-releases/cf-release.yml`, replace any occurrence of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.xip.io with your own custom domain, you may end up with something like this:

```
    resource_directory_key: vincloud.com-cc-resources
    srv_api_uri: https://api.vincloud.com
```

```

+------------------------------------+---------+---------------+-------------+
```

you can now use `cf target http://api.<YOURDOMAIN>` instead of the xip.io version.

### Running offline

You may not have network connectivity sometimes. I had a hard time getting OSX to use the nameserver once my network was down, thanks to [this serverfault post](http://serverfault.com/questions/22419/set-dns-server-on-os-x-even-when-without-internet-connection/164215#164215)

Set all your network interface dns servers to 127.0.0.1:

```
   networksetup -setdnsservers Ethernet 127.0.0.1
   networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 127.0.0.1
    ...
```

Create a file `/etc/resolver/whatever`:
   nameserver 127.0.0.1
    domain .

Now this should work offline.
